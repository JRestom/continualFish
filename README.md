# 

-- EM computes Exact Matching (the metric to evaluate the accuracy of the model)
-- FFT performs full finetuning on a given model for the dataset selected
-- getGSM8K will download the GSM8K from huggingface (First you need to log in using your huggingFace token)
-- getModel will download the model (for now we chose tinyLlama, which has around 1B parameters)
